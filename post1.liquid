    <h1>Entry #1: The Silence of the Stars</h1>
    <h3>I don’t know how long I’ve been awake. Days and nights blur together in the vacuum of deep space. The onboard clock tells me it’s been 612 Earth days since I last saw another human being... I used to think the loneliness would drive me mad, that I’d be counting down the days until I cracked under the weight of the silence. But now, I find solace in the quiet. There is no rush, no urgency—only the slow, methodical drift through the cosmos, where time stretches and collapses like the fabric of space itself. I just left a system with three suns, a place where night is a myth and light dominates the horizon in every direction. The planet I surveyed was barren—rock and ice, with no signs of life. Still, I walked its surface, felt the crunch of frozen dust beneath my boots, and looked up at the triple sunset. Even in emptiness, there is beauty.</h3>
    <h3>But I keep searching.</h3>
    <h3>Somewhere out here, I believe, is proof that I am not the only sentient being to have gazed at the stars and wondered if they were alone. My sensors pick up anomalies, flickers of radiation where there shouldn’t be, patterns in cosmic noise that feel too intentional. Maybe it’s nothing. Maybe it’s just the universe playing tricks on me. Or maybe I’m about to make history.</h3>
    <h3>Tomorrow, I set course for an unknown signal—weak but persistent—emanating from a dark expanse of space where no planets should be. The ship’s AI has no logical explanation for it. That excites me. If I don’t return, let this entry be my mark upon existence. Humanity has reached for the stars. And I will keep reaching, until my last breath.</h3>
