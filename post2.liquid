    <h1> Entry #2: The Echo in the Void </h1>
    <h3>The signal wasn’t natural. I know that now. I reached the coordinates three days ago. The system was dead—no planets, no asteroid belts, not even the whisper of a dust cloud. Just a single, dark object adrift in the void. It wasn’t a ship. At least, not like any ship I’ve ever seen. Metal, but not corroded. Ancient, but undamaged. A structure built by something that understood physics in ways I can barely grasp. Its surface was covered in carvings—symbols, maybe, or a language. The AI tried to analyze them, but it had no reference point.</h3>
    <h3>And then the signal changed.</h3>
    <h3>It wasn’t random static anymore. It was a voice. Not words—tones, pulses, something closer to music than speech. It filled my ship, resonated through the hull, vibrated in my bones. And for a moment, just a fleeting instant, I felt something impossible. I felt watched. I tried to respond. Played back mathematical sequences, prime numbers, anything that might show intelligence. But the moment I transmitted, the object went silent. As if it had been waiting for me to speak just to prove I could. And then, as suddenly as it had begun, the signal vanished. I marked the location, recorded my findings. But I can’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t meant to find it. That it was testing me, observing me. I am alone again.</h3>
    <h3>But now I wonder… am I really?</h3>
